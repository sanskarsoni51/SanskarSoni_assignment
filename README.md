# SanskarSoni_assignment

I have completed this assignment where i have made an rest API with the help of node.js, express.js and javascript and with the help of SQLITE3 database.
In this project i have added CRUD operations in this and i have tested it on postman app.

In this project i have fist made an server with the help of express and then i integrated the database for which i have learned SQLITE3 db which is an light weight database in which i learned about the knex which is used to perform query for javascript with different databases and as i used knex in it for SQLITE3 and implemented all the CRUD operartions and after that i created a controller for the functions of api and after that i connected it with the routes as i wanted in that.

The main task in the projrct was to learn database,

As i have made this using JavaScript not TypeScript because i am not that proficient with typescript and i will learn typescript.

If i had more time then i would have implemented the error controller and also i would have created the routes for different functionalities like sending alerts about the tasks and also integrated the authentication and authorization and other security in the project. and would have learned typescript and made this in typescript
